## About the Collection

The Niagara Peninsula was first settled by Indigenous humans about 13,000 years ago (Niagara Falls History Museum). It was not until 1678 that Father Louis Hennepin came to Niagara and published the first pictorial representation of the Falls (Spencer, 1). Following them was a barrage of explorers aiming to make the “New World” their home. In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution had begun, and the lines between nature and culture became blurrier and blurrier as the European settlers industrialized the area. Eventually, industry became inextricable from our views of the landscape, and this intertwinement is evident in the visual culture produced throughout these decades. This exhibition explores the visual culture of 19th century Niagara that displayed this relationship between factory and nature, and present industry as an embedded, inexorable feature of Niagara’s environment. 

In the 19th century, there was an ideal of the “unspoiled landscape”, unmarred by human activity. Wild nature had become a symbol of national pride and uniqueness, and Niagara was no exception (Haila 131). These attitudes are reflected in many critical articles from the turn of the century, such as Alton D. Adams’ “Niagara Falls Already Ruined!” (1906), Henry M. Hyde’s “Who Owns the Earth and How Did They Get It?” (1909) and particularly in Mary B. Hartt’s “The Passing of Niagara” (1901), all which disparage the overtaking of the Falls and the changes hydroelectricity makes to their appearance, as well as the exhaustion of resources such as coal and anthracite (Hyde, 562). 

Industrial development at, in and on the Falls began in the late 1800s. American civil engineer Thomas Evershed devised plans to develop “unconventional methods of water delivery”, so that the water in the areas above and below the falls could be used for hydropower. He proposed a canal to divert the water from the Niagara River to a location above Goat Island, distributing water to various mills and power companies along its way before discharging the used water near Rainbow Bridge (Oxley, 71). This resulted in a string of industrial stations along the river banks, merging Niagara’s natural cliffs with a man-made mechanical facade. Even the water itself is both a mix of nature and culture, having been utilized, expended and recycled through the many powerful generators of the power houses and mills for human consumption. 

Other developments in the area included the cofferdam, the tailrace tunnel, underground conduits, the wheelpit, Terrapin Tower and more.

The area was also adapted for tourist attractions in and across the Falls, on Goat Island and Queen Victoria Park. Various bridges and tunnels were constructed to enable tours through the falls and the islands, while several bridges crisscross over the rapids, connecting Canada and America technologically. Many images show the vista populated by travellers and tourists, even sometimes overwhelming photos of the Falls with their presence. The crowds of people serve as an integral part of the view, showing how the fast-growing population and developments encroached on the nature of the Falls.
